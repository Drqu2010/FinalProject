Guess the Disney character's name. A Python terminal game. Over one hundred different characters to guess. The number of guess the player has is the number of letters are in the character's name plus one extra guess. If the player looses then a "You Lose" photo will pop up. If the player wins, they get a "You Win" photo with a trophy! Yeah! Have fun and test how many Disney characters you actually know.
